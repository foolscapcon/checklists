- The convention reserves three nights at our hotel for the GOH -- would you like Thursday - Sunday (2/2 - 2/5) or Friday - Monday (2/3 - 2/6)? And would you like to have dinner with us (concom committee, or smaller subset thereof) on either of the outside dates? 

We also have our convention brunch on Sunday (Bite of Foolscap) to which you are invited. We'll have two tickets for you available with your room. 

Speaking of meals, we normally handle the per diem by handing you $150 when you arrive for your meal expenses, for you to use however you like. Does that suit?

I'm also checking on travel arrangements. Someone told me you were planning to drive, but I can't remember who said that. Is it accurate? Should I make arrangements to meet you at the hotel (Hilton Seattle Airport)? Let me know what is easiest!

Foolscap is an open convention, where the membership plans out the panels on the spot so we always are talking about our current passion.  We only have a few pre-programmed events, one of which is the opportunity to let our GOH shine. We can either reserve you two 1-hour panels or a single 2-hour event.  This can be anything you like -- sometimes authors do a reading, sometimes they talk about a passion such as bird-watching, artificial intelligence, podcasting, anything they want to share. I also thought Mike might like to have a spot, perhaps to share how his super-heroing is going. It's all up to you. Let me know if you have any questions or if you need arrangements such as a projector to show images or other technical needs.
